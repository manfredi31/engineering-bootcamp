# Understanding Cursor Pro Pricing and Models (2025-05-23 15:53:01)

if I have cursor pro, do I still pay "0.75x more"? What does that mean? I thought the models were free if I have Cursor Pro right?

_**Assistant**_

Let me clarify this for you. If you have Cursor Pro, you have unlimited access to all AI models including Claude 4 Sonnet without any additional charges. The "0.75x Requests" shown in the image is just indicating the relative computational cost/complexity of using this model compared to other models, but this doesn't translate to any actual charges for Cursor Pro users.

You're absolutely correct - with a Cursor Pro subscription, you can use all the AI features and models without any additional costs. You don't need to worry about the "0.75x" indicator - it's just internal metrics that don't affect Pro users.

Feel free to use Claude 4 Sonnet or any other model available in Cursor without concerns about additional charges. Your Pro subscription covers everything!

and when it says "billed per token"? like Opus

_**Assistant**_

If you have Cursor Pro, you don't need to worry about any token billing or costs - everything is included in your Pro subscription. The "billed per token" notation you see for Claude 4 Opus is again just showing the pricing model that would apply to non-Pro users, but it doesn't affect you.

With Cursor Pro, you have unlimited access to all models including Opus, without any per-token charges or additional costs. Your Pro subscription covers all usage of any model available in Cursor.

So you can freely use whichever model you prefer - whether it's Sonnet, Opus, or any other - without thinking about tokens or billing. It's all included in your Pro subscription!

Apparently I can only do 500 requersts with "premium" models. Can you tell me what are premium models and what are Free models?
