# React Hook Error Troubleshooting (2025-05-28 07:32:24)

_**User**_

I am getting this error. Can you help please?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can help you fix the error you're seeing. The error message indicates two main issues:

1. Invalid hook call - The `useNavigate` hook is being called outside of a function component
2. Cannot read properties of null - There's an issue with context usage

The problem is in your `HomePage.jsx` file where you're trying to use the `useNavigate` hook incorrectly. Let me fix this for you.

Let me explain what's wrong and how to fix it:

1. In React, hooks (like `useNavigate`) must be called inside the body of a function component
2. You're currently calling `useNavigate` at the top level of your file, outside the component

Here's how we'll fix it:

---

```diff
  import './HomePage.css';
  import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
- 
- const navigate = useNavigate()
  
  export default function HomePage() {
+     const navigate = useNavigate();
+     
      return (
          <>
```

---

This change moves the `useNavigate` hook inside the component function where it belongs. This follows React's Rules of Hooks, which state that:

1. Hooks can only be called inside React function components
2. Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component
3. Hooks can't be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions

The error should now be resolved. The `navigate` function will be properly initialized inside the component and can be used in your onClick handler.

For context, this is a common mistake when learning React. Hooks are special functions that let you "hook into" React features, but they must follow these specific rules to work correctly. The `useNavigate` hook specifically is part of React Router and helps with programmatic navigation in your app.

Is there anything specific about React hooks or navigation that you'd like me to explain further?

How do I do so that the second line of this P is at the center and doesn't start from left? Does it make sense? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you want to center-align the text in the paragraph so that when it wraps to the second line, it starts from the center rather than from the left. This is a common styling requirement for better visual presentation.

Let me help you add the necessary CSS to achieve this. We'll need to add a text-align property to center the text.

| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Read file: doctorbookingfrontend/src/pages/HomePage.css

---

I see that you've already added a `top-specialty-section` class to the div. Let me add the text-align property to center the text properly.

---

```diff
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
+     text-align: center;
+     max-width: 600px;
+     margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
```

---

I've made the following changes to center your text properly:

1. Added `text-align: center` to center all text content
2. Added `max-width: 600px` to control the width of the text container
3. Added `margin: 0 auto` to center the container itself

These changes will ensure that:
- The text is centered within its container
- When the text wraps to a second line, it will stay centered
- The text block has a reasonable width for comfortable reading

The paragraph should now look properly centered with both lines aligned in the center rather than starting from the left. This creates a more balanced and visually appealing layout.

Is this more like what you were looking for? Let me know if you'd like to adjust the width or make any other styling changes!

Can you add a navigation to URL /doctors/specialty + query paramter depending on specialty ON CLICK of these icons?

i.e for General Physician is http://localhost:5173/doctors?specialty=General+Physician

Use React Router useNavigate 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add navigation to each specialty item using `useNavigate`. We'll modify the `speciality-item` divs to handle clicks and navigate to the appropriate URLs.

---

```diff
      const navigate = useNavigate();
      
+     const handleSpecialtyClick = (specialty) => {
+         navigate(`/doctors?specialty=${encodeURIComponent(specialty)}`);
+     };
+ 
      return (
          <>
```

```diff
                  </div>
                  <div className="speciality-grid">
-                     <div className="speciality-item">
+                     <div className="speciality-item" onClick={() => handleSpecialtyClick('General Physician')}>
                          <div className="speciality-icon">üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è</div>
                          <span>General physician</span>
                      </div>
-                     <div className="speciality-item">
+                     <div className="speciality-item" onClick={() => handleSpecialtyClick('Gynecologist')}>
                          <div className="speciality-icon">üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è</div>
                          <span>Gynecologist</span>
                      </div>
-                     <div className="speciality-item">
+                     <div className="speciality-item" onClick={() => handleSpecialtyClick('Dermatologist')}>
                          <div className="speciality-icon">üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è</div>
                          <span>Dermatologist</span>
                      </div>
-                     <div className="speciality-item">
+                     <div className="speciality-item" onClick={() => handleSpecialtyClick('Pediatrician')}>
                          <div className="speciality-icon">üë∂</div>
                          <span>Pediatricians</span>
                      </div>
-                     <div className="speciality-item">
+                     <div className="speciality-item" onClick={() => handleSpecialtyClick('Neurologist')}>
                          <div className="speciality-icon">üß†</div>
                          <span>Neurologist</span>
                      </div>
-                     <div className="speciality-item">
+                     <div className="speciality-item" onClick={() => handleSpecialtyClick('Gastroenterologist')}>
                          <div className="speciality-icon">üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è</div>
                          <span>Gastroenterologist</span>
```

---

I've made the following changes:

1. Added a `handleSpecialtyClick` function that takes a specialty name and uses `navigate` to go to the appropriate URL
2. Added `onClick` handlers to each specialty item that call this function with the appropriate specialty
3. Used `encodeURIComponent` to properly encode the specialty names for the URL (this handles spaces and special characters)

Now when you click on any specialty:
- It will navigate to `/doctors` with the appropriate specialty query parameter
- The URLs will be properly encoded (e.g., "General Physician" becomes "General+Physician" in the URL)
- The cursor will change to a pointer on hover (this is already handled by the existing CSS)

For example:
- Clicking "General physician" navigates to: `/doctors?specialty=General+Physician`
- Clicking "Neurologist" navigates to: `/doctors?specialty=Neurologist`
- And so on...

The navigation will be instant and will work with your browser's history (you can use the back button to return to the home page).

Is there anything else you'd like me to explain about how this works?

_**User**_

Right now the Top Doctors Section is hardcoded data. Though, if you loook at @DoctorsPage.jsx , @DoctorsCard.jsx , and @DoctorsList.jsx , I already built logic to fetch Doctors Data and create cards for each.

Dont write any code for now. What do you think is the way we could do that in the Homepage reuitilizng that logic?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your existing code, I can suggest a clean approach to reuse your doctors components in the Homepage. Here's my thought process:

1. Your `DoctorsList` component already has:
   - The API fetching logic using React Query
   - Error and loading states
   - The `DoctorsCard` component that handles the display and navigation

2. For the Homepage's "Top Doctors" section, you have two main options:

   **Option 1 - Reuse DoctorsCard only:**
   - Import and use just the `DoctorsCard` component
   - Create a new API fetch specifically for top doctors
   - This gives you more flexibility but duplicates the fetching logic

   **Option 2 - Reuse DoctorsList with props (Recommended):**
   - Modify `DoctorsList` to accept props like:
     - `limit` - to show only a certain number of doctors
     - `layout` - to handle different grid layouts (homepage vs doctors page)
     - `showFilters` - to optionally hide the specialty sidebar
   - This way you reuse both the fetching logic and the presentation
   - You could add a parameter to your API to fetch only top doctors

I would recommend Option 2 because:
1. It follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
2. Any improvements to the doctors fetching logic would automatically apply everywhere
3. It maintains consistency in how doctors are displayed across your app
4. It's more maintainable - changes to the card design or data structure only need to be made in one place

Would you like me to show you how to implement one of these approaches?

---

_**User**_

Let's do Option 1. Implement that in @HomePage.jsx please.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the HomePage to use the `DoctorsCard` component with its own data fetching. We'll replace the hardcoded doctor cards with real data.

  import './HomePage.css';
  import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
+ import { useAuth } from '../context/auth/AuthContext';
+ import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
+ import axios from 'axios';
+ import DoctorsCard from '../components/doctors/DoctorsCard';
  
  export default function HomePage() {
      const navigate = useNavigate();
+     const { token } = useAuth();
      
      const handleSpecialtyClick = (specialty) => {
          navigate(`/doctors?specialty=${encodeURIComponent(specialty)}`);
      };
+ 
+     const { 
+         data: doctorsData,
+         isLoading,
+         isError,
+         error,
+     } = useQuery({
+         queryKey: ['topDoctors'],
+         queryFn: async () => {
+             const response = await axios.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/doctors', {
+                 headers: {
+                     'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
+                     "Content-Type": "application/json"
+                 }
+             });
+             // Only take the first 6 doctors for the homepage
+             return response.data.slice(0, 6);
+         },
+         enabled: !!token,
+     });

+                 </button>
              </section>
  
```

I've made the following changes:

1. Added necessary imports:
   - `useAuth` for getting the authentication token
   - `useQuery` for data fetching
   - `axios` for making API requests
   - `DoctorsCard` component

2. Added data fetching using React Query:
   - Uses the same API endpoint as your doctors page
   - Limits the results to 6 doctors using `slice(0, 6)`
   - Includes loading and error states
   - Only fetches when there's a valid token (`enabled: !!token`)

3. Replaced the hardcoded doctor cards with:
   - Loading state display
   - Error state display
   - Mapped `DoctorsCard` components with real data

4. Made the "more" button functional:
   - Added an `onClick` handler to navigate to the full doctors page

The main differences from your `DoctorsList` component are:
- No specialty filtering
- Limited to 6 doctors
- No sidebar
- Simpler layout

This implementation gives you real data while maintaining the homepage's design. The cards will look consistent with the rest of your application since they use the same `DoctorsCard` component.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?
