Based on my research, I recommend installing the latest stable version of Tailwind CSS v4.1.8, which was released in May 2025. This version includes all the features from v4.0 plus additional improvements from the v4.1.x releases, including:

1. Text shadow utilities
2. Improved masking elements with mask-* utilities
3. Better browser compatibility and fallbacks for older browsers
4. Fine-grained text wrapping controls
5. Colored drop shadows
6. New variants for pointer/touch device detection
7. Safe alignment utilities
8. And various other enhancements

To install Tailwind CSS v4.1.8, you would need to:

1. Install the core packages:
```bash
npm install tailwindcss@4.1.8 @tailwindcss/postcss
```

2. Set up PostCSS configuration (if using PostCSS) or use the Vite plugin (if using Vite)

3. Import Tailwind in your CSS:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

The v4.1.x series is stable and production-ready, with numerous bug fixes and improvements over the initial v4.0 release. It also maintains good browser compatibility with fallbacks for older browsers, making it a solid choice for new projects.

Would you like me to help you set up Tailwind CSS with your preferred build tool (PostCSS, Vite, etc.)?
