Looking at the code and linter errors, there's a syntax error in the `RentModal.tsx` file around the `STEPS.INFO` section. The main issue is with how the JSX is being assigned to `bodyContent`. 

The current code has:
```131:136:airbnb_clone-frontend/src/components/modals/RentModal.tsx
    if (step === STEPS.INFO) {
        bodyContent = {
            <div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
            
            </div>
        }
    }
```

The problem is that the JSX is wrapped in curly braces `{}` which makes JavaScript treat it as an object literal, but it should be directly assigned instead. Let me fix this syntax error.

I'll propose an edit to correct this:

---

```diff
  
      if (step === STEPS.INFO) {
-         bodyContent = {
+         bodyContent = (
              <div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
-                 <Heading
-                     title="Where is your place located?"
-                     subtitle
              
              </div>
-         }
+         )
      }
  
```

---

The fix involves changing the curly braces `{}` to parentheses `()` when assigning JSX to `bodyContent`. This is the correct syntax for JSX assignments in React. The pattern follows what's already being used in the other steps of the modal, like in the `STEPS.LOCATION` section.

There are also some other linter errors about `rentModal` not being found, but those appear to be false positives since we can see that `useRentModal` hook is properly imported and used at the top of the component. The hook should provide the `rentModal` object with `isOpen` and `onClose` properties.

Would you like me to help you add the actual content for the INFO step of the rental form? It seems like that section is currently empty and would need form inputs for guest count, room count, and bathroom count based on the form's default values.

why do we put onChange and value in the callback? I will define onChange and vlaue in the parent which is @RentModal.tsx
