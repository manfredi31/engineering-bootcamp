I am very very new to programming, and I want to learn about building fullstack applications. Frontend with React, and backend with Flask. 

I have built a full backend at @doctorbookingapi  with authentication, database models, and different API endpoints, and now I want to build a React App on top of it. 


You should assume I have 0 knowledge about React, Flask, and connecting React to Flask.

The frontend is at @doctorbookingfrontend.
