whats the mistake here?

Looking at the code and linter errors, there are a few indentation and closing tag issues in the `App.tsx` file. The main problems are:

1. The `BrowserRouter` tag is incorrectly indented, causing confusion with the closing tags
2. The closing tags are not properly aligned with their opening counterparts

Let me fix this by properly formatting the JSX structure.

```diff
      <>
        <ToasterProvider />
-         <AuthProvider> 
-         <BrowserRouter> 
+       <AuthProvider>
+         <BrowserRouter>
            <Routes>
              {/* Layout with NavBar but NO Footer (Login/Register */}
              <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
-                 <Route />
+               <Route />
              </Route>
            </Routes>
+         </BrowserRouter>
        </AuthProvider>
-       </BrowserRouter>
      </>
    )
```

I've fixed the code by:

1. Properly aligning the `AuthProvider`, `BrowserRouter`, and their closing tags
2. Fixed the indentation of the nested `Route` components
3. Ensured the closing tags are in the correct order: `BrowserRouter` should close before `AuthProvider`

The structure is now properly nested as:
```
<>
  <ToasterProvider />
  <AuthProvider>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route>
          <Route />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </AuthProvider>
</>
```

This should resolve all the linter errors related to JSX tag structure. The components are now properly nested and closed in the correct order.
