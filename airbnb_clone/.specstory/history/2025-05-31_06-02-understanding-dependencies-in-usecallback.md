# Understanding dependencies in useCallback (2025-05-31 08:02:03)

I see why we are giving the user in the dependnencies array. Of course if the user changes we want to rerender the onRent handler. Though I dont get why we also pass loginmodal.

_**Assistant**_

Let me explain why `loginModal` is included in the dependencies array of the `useCallback` hook.

The `loginModal` dependency is necessary because the callback function uses `loginModal.onOpen()` inside its body. This is a function that comes from the `loginModal` object obtained from the `useLoginModal` hook. 

Here's why it's important:
1. If `loginModal` changes (gets a new reference), we want the callback to use the latest version of `loginModal.onOpen()`
2. Without including `loginModal` in the dependencies array, we would violate the React hooks rules and potentially have stale closure issues where the callback might reference an old version of `loginModal`
3. Even though `loginModal` is unlikely to change frequently (if at all), React's hooks rules require us to include all external values that the callback depends on

However, there is a syntax error in the current code. The dependencies array is incorrectly attached to the function body closure rather than being passed as a second argument to `useCallback`. Let me fix that:

---

```diff
          }
  
- 
-     }[user, loginModal])
+     }, [user, loginModal]);
  
      return (
```

---

The fix moves the dependencies array to be properly passed as the second argument to `useCallback` and adds a semicolon at the end. This is the correct syntax for `useCallback` in React:
- First argument: The callback function
- Second argument: The dependencies array

Now the code will work as intended, recreating the callback only when either `user` or `loginModal` changes, ensuring we always have access to the latest values of both dependencies.

How would loginModal change? In what circumstance?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me explain when `loginModal` could potentially change.

The `loginModal` is coming from a custom hook `useLoginModal()`. Looking at how these types of modal hooks are typically implemented in React applications, they usually return an object with state and methods (like `onOpen`, `onClose`, etc.). 

However, you raise a very good point - in practice, `loginModal` would likely be stable and not change between renders because:

1. If it's implemented as a typical modal hook, it would probably use something like `useState` or `useReducer` internally, which maintain stable references to their state updater functions
2. Any methods like `onOpen` and `onClose` would themselves likely be memoized with `useCallback`
3. The object returned from `useLoginModal` would likely be memoized as well

Let me check the implementation of `useLoginModal` to confirm this:

Ah, now I can give you a complete answer! Looking at the implementation of `useLoginModal`, I can see that it's created using Zustand (a state management library):

```typescript
const useLoginModal = create<LoginModalStore>((set) => ({
    isOpen: false,
    onOpen: () => set({ isOpen: true}),
    onClose: () => set({ isOpen: false})
}))
```

In this case, I was wrong in my initial assessment - `loginModal` actually **won't** change between renders! Here's why:

1. Zustand's `create` function creates a store that maintains a single instance throughout the application's lifecycle
2. The returned object with `isOpen`, `onOpen`, and `onClose` maintains stable references
3. The functions `onOpen` and `onClose` are created once when the store is initialized and never change

Therefore, including `loginModal` in the dependencies array of `useCallback` is actually unnecessary. The callback will never nee
