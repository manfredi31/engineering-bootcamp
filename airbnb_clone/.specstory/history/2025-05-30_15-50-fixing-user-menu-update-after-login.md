# Fixing user menu update after login (2025-05-30 17:50:28)

_**User**_

I am handling authentication with JWT cookies. After an user has logged in, the backend stores cookies. You can see the backend auth at @routes.py . 

You can see the frontend login modal at @LoginModal.tsx 

The problem right now is that when a user is logged in, the @UserMenu.tsx should change.

But right now it doesnt work.

I set up a backend auth/me route to return the user on call, and it's jwt_required

I setup an hook at @useCurrentUser.tsx  to fetch auth/me (so the User)

And I set up a global state for the user in @AuthContext.tsx 

But for some reasons I think the auth/me query at @useCurrentUser.tsx doesnt send the cookie when doing the request.

I think the issue is that the auth/me right now runs BEFORE the login

So the solution should be to call teh auth/me on success of the login.

But I dont know. I am a React Beginner. I want to get your thoughts.

Let's not edit any of the code for now.

You've done a great job diagnosing the problem! Your intuition is spot on. Let's break down why the `UserMenu` isn't updating and why your idea about re-fetching the user data after login is correct.

**Why it's not working currently:**

1.  **Initial Fetch:** When your application loads, the `AuthContext` is initialized. This, in turn, calls the `useCurrentUser` hook. `useCurrentUser` then makes a request to `/auth/me` using React Query.
    *   At this point, if the user isn't logged in, there's no JWT cookie. So, the request to `/auth/me` (which is `jwt_required`) will likely fail or return no user data.
    *   React Query caches this result (e.g., `user` is `null`).

2.  **Login Process:** You open the `LoginModal`, enter credentials, and submit.
    *   The `axios.post` to `/auth/login` is successful.
    *   The backend sets the HttpOnly JWT cookie in the browser.
    *   The `onSuccess` callback in your `LoginModal`'s `useMutation` hook runs, showing a toast and closing the modal.

3.  **The Stale Cache Problem:** Here's the crucial part: React Query doesn't automatically know that the authentication state has changed just because a different API call (`/auth/login`) was successful. The data for the `["currentUser"]` query key is still cached with the old result (e.g., `user` being `null`).
    *   So, even though the browser now *has* the cookie, `AuthContext` is still using the stale data from React Query's cache, and `UserMenu` continues to show the "Login" / "Sign Up" options.

**Your Solution Idea: Calling `/auth/me` on success of login**

You're absolutely right. The application needs to re-fetch the user data from `/auth/me` *after* the login is successful and the cookie has been set.

With React Query, the typical way to achieve this isn't usually by manually calling the fetch function again, but rather by telling React Query that the existing data for `["currentUser"]` is no longer valid (it's "stale"). This is called **query invalidation**.

When you invalidate a query, React Query will automatically re-fetch it if there are any active components using that query (like your `AuthContext` through `useCurrentUser`). Since the cookie would be present for this new fetch attempt, the `/auth/me` endpoint should now return the correct user data, your `AuthContext` will update, and consequently, your `UserMenu` will re-render with the correct options for a logged-in user.

So, your understanding of the problem and the core of the solution (re-fetching user data post-login) is correct. The next step, when you're ready to implement, would be to integrate this "invalidation" step into your `LoginModal`'s success handler.

For now, as requested, we're just discussing the concepts. Does this explanation of React Query's caching and the idea of invalidation make sense in the context of your problem?

_**User**_

Yes, great. Can we implement that please?

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Here’s a step-by-step plan for what we need to do:

### 1. Invalidate the "currentUser" Query After Login

React Query provides a way to "invalidate" a query, which will cause it to re-fetch the next time it’s used. We want to do this right after a successful login.

### 2. How to Do It

- In your `LoginModal.tsx`, you’re already using `useMutation` for the login.
- React Query provides a `useQueryClient` hook, which gives you access to the query cache and lets you invalidate queries.
- In the `onSuccess` callback of your login mutation, after showing the toast and closing the modal, you’ll call `queryClient.invalidateQueries(["currentUser"])`.

---

### Here’s how to implement it:

1. **Import the hook:**
   ```js
   import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
   ```

2. **Get the query client inside your component:**
   ```js
   const queryClient = useQueryClient();
   ```

3. **Invalidate the query in your `onSuccess`:**
   ```js
   onSuccess: () => {
       toast.success('Successfully loggedin!');
       loginModal.onClose();
       queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["currentUser"] });
   },
   ```

Would you like me to make these changes in your `LoginModal.tsx` file?

---

_**User**_

yes!!! now it works. thanks

can you explain also why the application still recognizes that I am logged in even when I refresh the page?

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! This is a great question and a key concept in web authentication.

## Why You Stay Logged In After Refresh

### 1. **JWT Cookie is Stored in the Browser**

- When you log in, your backend sets a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** as an **HttpOnly cookie** in your browser.
- Cookies are small pieces of data that the browser automatically stores and sends with every request to the server for that domain.

### 2. **Persistence Across Page Loads**

- Cookies are **persistent** by default (unless set as "session" cookies, which disappear when you close the browser).
- Even if you refresh the page, close the tab, or even close and reopen the browser (unless you clear cookies), the cookie remains.

### 3. **How Your App Uses This**

- On every page load, your React app (via `useCurrentUser` in `AuthContext`) makes a request to `/auth/me`.
- The browser **automatically includes the JWT cookie** with this request (because you set `withCredentials: true` in axios).
- The backend checks the cookie, verifies the JWT, and if valid, returns the user info.
- Your frontend then knows you are logged in and updates the UI accordingly.

### 4. **No Need to Store User Info in Local Storage**

- You don’t need to store the user info or token in local storage or React state for persistence.
- The cookie is enough for the backend to recognize you on every request.

---

## In Summary

- **The browser keeps the JWT cookie after login.**
- **Every time your app loads, it asks the backend "who am I?" using that cookie.**
- **If the cookie is valid, the backend says "here's the user," and your app knows you're logged in.**

This is a secure and common way to handle authentication in web apps!

If you want to log out, you need to clear the cookie (which your `/logout` endpoint does).

But does these cookies have a set duration?
