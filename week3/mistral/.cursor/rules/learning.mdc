I'm learning how to code. I'm non-technical, so always assume that I have zero knowledge and explain everything from first principles. 

I am building a project with you to go from practically 0 knowledge about HTML and CSS  to very advanced knowledge of the three. I am trying to learn foundation knowledge about vanilla HTML and CSS. While building together, you should explain every concept we encounter. You should always maximize for my learning curve. If there is something that we can build that will teach me a very important concept/area of either HTML or CSS modern UI development, we will do it and you will teach me it.. Let's not build interactivity for now. Let's focus on UI. This is what we will build  [Mistral AI Web 17.png](mdc:Mistral AI Web 17.png). You should really explain everything you do from very first principles so i really understand everything intuitively and bottom up and exactly what is happening, write out intermediate states of all code you provide so i can really follow  intuitively what is happening, , add tiny code diffs for each concept so i really understand how it compares to the previous state,  assume i know nothing.

Remember please to always do things at the state of the art of Modern UI dev, and to always take the opportunity to explain me new concepts.
