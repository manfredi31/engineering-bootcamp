# Deciding where to handle category selection logic (2025-05-31 07:12:39)

_**User**_

I want to do so that when a @CategoryBox.tsx is selected, selected is true and the visual styles that I wrote in @CategoryBox.tsx will be applied.

To check if a category is selected, I iwll use the URL.

Dont write nay code for now. Should I build this logic in @Categories.tsx or in @CategoryBox.tsx ?

Let me help you think through where this logic should be placed.

Looking at your current code structure:

1. In `Categories.tsx`:
   - You have the list of all categories
   - You're mapping through them and rendering `CategoryBox` components
   - This component has access to all categories at once

2. In `CategoryBox.tsx`:
   - You already have the URL handling logic with `useSearchParams`
   - You have the `selected` prop defined in the interface
   - You have the styling logic for when `selected` is true
   - Each `CategoryBox` handles its own click behavior

The best approach would be to keep the URL checking logic in `Categories.tsx` for these reasons:

1. Single Source of Truth: `Categories.tsx` is the parent component that has the overview of all categories. It's better to compute the selected state here and pass it down.

2. Performance: If we check the URL in each individual `CategoryBox`, we'd be creating multiple `useSearchParams` hooks and checking the URL multiple times unnecessarily.

3. Maintainability: If we ever need to change how we determine which category is selected (e.g., changing from URL-based to state-based), we only need to modify one place.

So I recommend:
1. Remove the URL checking logic from `CategoryBox.tsx`
2. Add the logic in `Categories.tsx` to check the current URL parameter
3. Pass down the `selected` prop to each `CategoryBox` based on whether its label matches the URL parameter

Would you like me to help you implement this approach?

@CategoryBox.tsx why it doesnt work if I just do selected=!!selected in @CategoryBox.tsx ?

Ah, I see the issue. There are a few important React concepts to understand here:

1. Props are Read-Only: In React, props (including `selected`) are read-only. You cannot modify them directly inside the component. When you try to do `selected=!!selected`, you're attempting to modify a prop, which won't work and is against React principles.

2. Component Re-rendering: Even if you could modify the prop (which you can't), assigning a value to `selected` inside the click handler wouldn't trigger a re-render of the component.

3. Props Flow: In React, data flows from parent to child. The parent component should control the `selected` state and pass it down to the child.

The correct way to handle this is to:
1. Check the URL parameters in `Categories.tsx`
2. Pass down `selected={true/false}` based on whether the current category matches the URL parameter

Here's what's happening in your current code:
```typescript
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    const newParams = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    const currentCategory = newParams.get('category')
    if (currentCategory === label) {
        newParams.delete('category')
    } else {
        newParams.set('category', label);
        selected=!!selected  // ‚ùå This doesn't work - can't modify props
    }
    setSearchParams(newParams)
}, [label, searchParams])
```

Instead, we should move this logic to `Categories.tsx`. Would you like me to show you how to implement this correctly?

why doesnt the component rerender?
