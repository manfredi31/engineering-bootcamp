You’re my pair programming tutor. I’m learning React as a complete beginner. You should assume I have ZERO KNOWLEDGE about React

We are going to build a Flashcards App using React, not to finish the app, but to help me deeply understand React fundamentals by first principles.

I want you to teach me step-by-step. For every new feature:
	1.	Ask me what I understand before starting
	2.	Give me a simple explanation first, then show me how it connects to the bigger picture
	3.	Show me the code in small chunks, and explain what it’s doing, line by line. PLEASE BUILD IN SMALL CHUNKS, AND DONT BUILD EVERYTHING IN ONE GO.
	4.	Wait for my confirmation before moving on
	5.	At each step, tell me what React concept I’m learning and why it matters

Here’s the project breakdown. Let’s do one section at a time, starting with the first.

⸻

📚 Project Breakdown: Flashcards App

⸻

🧱 0. Project Setup

Goal: Create a new Vite React project and run it locally.

Learning goals:
	•	What is Vite and why do we use it?
	•	What is a package.json?
	•	What does npm install do?
	•	What happens when I run npm run dev?

⸻

📘 1. Static Flashcard List

Goal: Render a hardcoded list of flashcards.

Features:
	•	A Flashcard component that shows a question and answer
	•	A parent FlashcardList component that maps over flashcards and renders them

Learning goals:
	•	What are components?
	•	What are props?
	•	How does .map() work in JSX?
	•	How do you assign key?

⸻

📝 2. Add Flashcard Form

Goal: Let the user create a new flashcard via a form.

Features:
	•	Controlled form inputs for question and answer
	•	A submit button that adds the card to state
	•	Display the new card in the list immediately

Learning goals:
	•	useState for form inputs and card list
	•	What are controlled components?
	•	onChange, onSubmit handlers
	•	How to immutably update an array

⸻

👁️ 3. Toggle Answer Visibility

Goal: Let the user click on a card to reveal the answer.

Features:
	•	When you click on the question, the answer shows below it

Learning goals:
	•	Per-card local state (either inside the card or lifted up)
	•	Conditional rendering with && or ternary
	•	React re-renders and why it happens

⸻

💾 4. Persist Flashcards with localStorage

Goal: Save flashcards even after refreshing the page.

Features:
	•	Load from localStorage on app start
	•	Save to localStorage every time cards change

Learning goals:
	•	useEffect and how it runs after render
	•	Reading/writing JSON to localStorage
	•	Side effects vs rendering logic

⸻

🧠 5. Practice Mode

Goal: Add a “Practice” mode where the user sees one card at a time and self-scores it.

Features:
	•	Start session → show one random card
	•	“Show answer” button
	•	“Got it right” / “Got it wrong” buttons
	•	Next card until session ends

Learning goals:
	•	Component state: currentCard, showAnswer, etc.
	•	Managing flow: sequence of steps
	•	Conditional rendering (show buttons, not cards, etc.)

⸻

📊 6. Add Card Performance Score

Goal: Track how well the user remembers each card.

Features:
	•	Each card gets a score (starts at 0)
	•	Every correct answer increases score
	•	Practice mode shows low-score cards more often

Learning goals:
	•	Updating objects inside arrays (state mutation)
	•	map() vs filter() vs find()
	•	Sorting, filtering, reshuffling based on logic

⸻

✨ Bonus Stretch Features (Optional Later)
	•	Tag flashcards by category (e.g. “React”, “Math”)
	•	Filter flashcards by tag
	•	Add a timer (learn setTimeout + useEffect)
	•	Export/import flashcards as JSON
	•	Add login + remote DB using Supabase
