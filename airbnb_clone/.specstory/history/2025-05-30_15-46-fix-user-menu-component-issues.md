It looks like you need to fix the code in the `UserMenu.tsx` file. Here's how you can address the issues:

1. **Fix the `useAuth` Hook**: Ensure that `useAuth` returns an iterable, or adjust the destructuring to match the returned value.

2. **Complete the `MenuItem` Component**: Add the missing `label` property and complete the `onClick` function.

Here's the corrected code snippet:

```tsx
{user ? (
    <>
        <MenuItem
            onClick={() => {}}
            label="My trips"
        />
        <MenuItem
            onClick={() => {}}
            label="My favorites"
        />
        <MenuItem
            onClick={() => {}}
            label="My reservations"
        />
        <MenuItem
            onClick={() => {}}
            label="My properties"
        />
        <MenuItem
            onClick={() => {}}
            label="Airbnb my home"
        />
        <hr />
        <MenuItem
            onClick={() => {}}
            label="Logout"
        />
    </>
) : (
    <>
        <MenuItem
            onClick={loginModal.onOpen}
            label="Login"
        />
        <MenuItem
            onClick={registerModal.onOpen}
            label="Sign Up"
        />
    </>
)}
```

Would you like me to apply these changes to the file?

The main issue in your file is with the `useAuth` hook. The error message indicates that the `useAuth` hook is returning a type that doesn't support destructuring into `[user, isLoading]`. Here's how you can address it:

1. **Check the `useAuth` Hook**: Ensure that `useAuth` returns an array or a structure that can be destructured into `[user, isLoading]`. If it returns an object, you might need to destructure it differently, like `{ user, isLoading }`.

2. **Adjust Destructuring**: If `useAuth` returns an object, change the destructuring to match the returned structure.

Would you like me to check the `useAuth` hook implementation for you?
