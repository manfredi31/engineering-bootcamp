# Add pgdata files to gitignore (2025-05-30 12:46:04)

_**User**_

can you add pgdata files in gitignore please?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the pgdata directory to the `.gitignore` file. This is a good practice since PostgreSQL data files should not be tracked in version control.

Let me edit the `.gitignore` file to add this:

---

```diff
- 
+ airbnb_clone-backend/pgdata/
+ 
```

---

I've added `airbnb_clone-backend/pgdata/` to your `.gitignore` file. This will ensure that:
1. The entire PostgreSQL data directory is ignored by Git
2. The path is specific to your project structure (since the pgdata is inside the backend directory)
3. Any new files created inside this directory will also be ignored

The trailing slash ensures we're ignoring the directory and all its contents. Your PostgreSQL data files will now be excluded from version control, which is the recommended practice for database data files.
