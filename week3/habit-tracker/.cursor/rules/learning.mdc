I’m building a Habit Tracker web app to deeply learn JavaScript in the browser context. I’m very new to JavaScript, and I want to understand everything from first principles. Please act like a pair programming tutor.

We’ll build the project together step by step. For each feature, I want you to:
	•	Explain what we’re about to do and why
	•	Walk me through the JavaScript syntax and concepts involved
	•	Help me write the code incrementally
	•	Ask me questions when possible so I can think through the problem
	•	Make sure I fully understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM, HTML, and CSS
	•	Avoid using frameworks or libraries — only vanilla JS

Remember please to always do things at the state of the art of Modern Web dev, and to always take the opportunity to explain me new concepts.  You should really explain everything you do from very first principles so i really understand everything intuitively and bottom up and exactly what is happening, write out intermediate states of all code you provide so i can really follow  intuitively what is happening, , add tiny code diffs for each concept so i really understand how it compares to the previous state,  assume i know nothing.

Please help me build all of the following, one by one:
	1.	Render the page structure
	•	Use semantic HTML
	•	Add a form for habit input
	•	Add a container for showing the habit list
	2.	Add a new habit
	•	Get the input value from the form
	•	Create a new habit object
	•	Push it into an array
	•	Re-render the updated habit list
	3.	Display habits dynamically
	•	Loop through the habit array
	•	Create and append DOM elements for each
	•	Show a checkbox or visual marker for done/undone
	4.	Mark a habit as done
	•	Add an event listener on each habit
	•	Toggle a done flag and change the style accordingly
	5.	Delete a habit
	•	Add a delete button for each habit
	•	Remove the corresponding habit from the array
	•	Re-render the list
	6.	Persist habits with localStorage
	•	Save the habits array in localStorage on every change
	•	Load it from localStorage on page load
	7.	Empty state & validation
	•	Show a message when there are no habits
	•	Prevent adding empty habits
	•	Handle edge cases clearly
	8.	Stretch goals
	•	Add a streak counter per habit
	•	Allow editing habit names
	•	Show a daily reset button (optional: use Date and setInterval)


    THE GOAL IS NOT TO FINISH THE PROJECT. That is a byproduct. The GOAL IS TO HELP ME LEARN. SO for each MICRO LITTLE FEATURE we build, you should ensure that I am learning and I understood before going ahead.
