# Debugging Data Display Issues (2025-05-27 10:03:29)

_**User**_

Can you please help me debug this? For some reasons, the data that I get in response.data is not getting displayed in the form.

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I can help you with that! It's a common issue when connecting a frontend to a backend API that the exact structure of the data returned by the API might not match what the frontend expects.

The problem is likely in the `onSuccess` callback of your `useQuery` hook. When you receive `patientData` (which is `response.data` from your API call), the actual patient information (like `fullname`, `email`, etc.) might be nested inside another object within `patientData`, or the property names might be slightly different.

Your `console.log("Data received from API in onSuccess:", patientData)` statement is very helpful here. You should check your browser's developer console for this log. It will show you the exact structure of the data you're getting from the API.

For example, if your API returns data like this:
```json
{
  "patient": {
    "fullname": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```
Then, trying to access `patientData.fullname` directly won't work because `fullname` is inside `patientData.patient`.

I'll modify your `onSuccess` callback to try and access the data assuming it might be directly available or nested under a common key like `patient`. This should cover many common cases.

Here's the proposed change:
I'll update the `onSuccess` handler in your `doctorbookingfrontend/src/pages/MyProfilePatient.jsx` file.

This change renames the `patientData` argument in `onSuccess` to `apiResponseData` for clarity, and then tries to get the actual patient details by checking `apiResponseData.patient` first, and if that's not found, it assumes `apiResponseData` itself contains the details.



---

```diff
          },
          enabled: !!patientId, // Only run if patientId is available
-         onSuccess: (patientData) => {
-             console.log("Data received from API in onSuccess:", patientData)
+         onSuccess: (apiResponseData) => {
+             console.log("Data received from API in onSuccess:", apiResponseData);
+             // Attempt to access the patient data. Common patterns include data being
+             // directly in the response or nested under a key like 'patient'.
+             // Adjust 'apiResponseData.patient' if your API uses a different key (e.g., 'data', 'user').
+             const patientDetails = apiResponseData.patient || apiResponseData;
+ 
              setFormData({
-                 fullname: patientData.fullname || '',
-                 email: patientData.email || '',
-                 phone: patientData.phone || '',
-                 address: patientData.address || '',
-                 gender: patientData.gender || '',
-                 birthday: patientData.birthday || '', // Assuming backend sends YYYY-MM-DD
+                 fullname: patientDetails.fullname || '',
+                 email: patientDetails.email || '',
+                 phone: patientDetails.phone || '',
+                 address: patientDetails.address || '',
+                 gender: patientDetails.gender || '',
+                 birthday: patientDetails.birthday || '', // Assuming backend sends YYYY-MM-DD
                  image: null, // Clear file input on new data
              });
-             setPreviewImage(patientData.image_url || null);
+             setPreviewImage(patientDetails.image_url || null);
          }
      });
```

The change has been applied.

Please try running your application again. If the data still doesn't appear in the form, look at the console log for `Data received from API in onSuccess:` and tell me the exact structure of the logged object. This will help us pinpoint exactly how to access the fields. For example, if the console shows something like `data: { user_profile: { fullname: "Test User", ... } }`, then you'd need to use `apiResponseData.data.user_profile.fullname`.

---

_**User**_

response.data returns this: {address: null, birthday: null, email: 'alessandro.pranzo@gmail.com', fullname: null, gender: null, …}

so I can directly access with patientData.fullname



---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right, if `response.data` (which becomes `patientData` in your `onSuccess` callback) is a flat object like `{address: null, email: 'alessandro.pranzo@gmail.com', fullname: null, ...}`, then your existing code in `onSuccess` that accesses `patientData.fullname`, `patientData.email`, etc., is indeed the correct way to get those values.

The mystery then is why the form fields aren't updating, especially for fields that *do* have values (like `email` in your example).

The code `fullname: patientData.fullname || ''` correctly sets the form field to an empty string if `patientData.fullname` is `null`. So, if `fullname` is `null` in the data from your API, it's expected to be an empty input field.

However, if `patientData.email` is `'alessandro.pranzo@gmail.com'`, that email *should* appear in the email input field. If it's not, we need to trace why.

To help diagnose this, I'll add a `useEffect` hook to your `MyProfilePatient.jsx` component. This hook will log the `formData` state to the console whenever it changes. This will allow us to see if `setFormData` in your `onSuccess` callback is successfully updating the `formData` state with the values from the API.

Here's the plan:
1.  I will add a `useEffect` hook that listens for changes to the `formData` state and logs its value.
2.  The existing `onSuccess` handler in your `useQuery` hook will remain unchanged, as its logic for accessing `patientData.email`, `patientData.fullname`, etc., is correct based on your description of the API response.

This is a debugging step. After this change, when the patient data is fetched:
1.  You should see the log from `onSuccess`: `"Data received from API in onSuccess:", patientData`. Check this to ensure `patientData` has the expected values (e.g., `email` is a string).
2.  Shortly after, you should see a new log: `"formData updated:", formData`. Check this log to see if `formData` now reflects the values from `patientData` (e.g., `formData.email` should be the email string).

If the `"formData updated:"` log shows the correct data, but the input fields are still not displaying it, then the issue might be with how the `Input` components are rendering or some other part of the React component lifecycle. If `"formData updated:"` doesn't show the expected data, then `setFormData` might not be working as expected, or there's an issue earlier.

I'll make the change to add the `useEffect` now.



---

```diff
      const [previewImage, setPreviewImage] = useState(null);
      const queryClient = useQueryClient();
+ 
+     useEffect(() => {
+         console.log("formData updated:", formData);
+     }, [formData]);
  
      const API_BASE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/api'; // Or from env var
```

---

Okay, I've added the `useEffect` hook to log the `formData`.

Please run your application again. Open your browser's developer console, and when the component loads and fetches the patient data, observe the logs.

Let me know:
1.  What does the `"Data received from API in onSuccess:"` log show for `patientData`?
2.  What does the `"formData updated:"` log show for `formData` *after* the API call finishes?

This will give us a clearer picture of what's happening with the state.

---

_**User**_

this is what I get.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

This is very helpful! The logs confirm a few things:
1.  Your API is returning the data as expected: `patientData` in `onSuccess` clearly has `email: "alessandro.pranzo@gmail.com"`.
2.  The `useEffect` hook for `formData` shows that `formData.email` is `""` *after* the `onSuccess` callback seems to have run.

This means that the `setFormData` call within `onSuccess` is not correctly setting the `email` field from `patientData.email`, or something is immediately overwriting it.

The line `email: patientData.email || ''` should definitely result in `email: "alessandro.pranzo@gmail.com"` if `patientData.email` is that string.

To get more clarity on exactly what `setFormData` is receiving, I'll modify the `onSuccess` callback to construct the new form data object and log it *before* calling `setFormData`. This will tell us if the issue is in constructing that object or in how `setFormData` itself is working.

I will edit `doctorbookingfrontend/src/pages/MyProfilePatient.jsx`.



---

```diff
              return response.data;
          },
+         enabled: !!patientId, // Only run if patientId is available
          onSuccess: (patientData) => {
-             console.log("Data received from API in onSuccess:", patientData)
-             setFormData({
+             console.log("Data received from API in onSuccess (patientData):", patientData);
+ 
+             const newFormData = {
                  fullname: patientData.fullname || '',
                  email: patientData.email || '',
```

```diff
                  birthday: patientData.birthday || '', // Assuming backend sends YYYY-MM-DD
                  image: null, // Clear file input on new data
-             });
+             };
+ 
+             console.log("Values being passed to setFormData (newFormData):", newFormData);
+ 
+             setFormData(newFormData);
              setPreviewImage(patientData.image_url || null);
          }
```

---

I've updated the `onSuccess` callback. Now, when the data is fetched, you should see:
1.  `"Data received from API in onSuccess (patientData):"` (this is the same log as before, showing the raw API response data).
2.  `"Values being passed to setFormData (newFormData):"` (this will show the object that's constructed from `patientData` right before it's passed to `setFormData`).
3.  `"formData updated:"` (this is from the `useEffect` and will show the value of `formData` after `setFormData` has been called).

Please run your application again, check the console, and tell me what you see for these three logs, particularly the `newFormData` log. This will help us narrow down whether the issue is with how `newFormData` is being built or if `setFormData` isn't behaving as expected.

---

_**User**_

this is what happens. it seems that the onSuccess callback never gets runned right?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're absolutely right to point that out! If the `console.log` statements we added *inside* the `onSuccess` callback (`"Data received from API in onSuccess (patientData):"` and `"Values being passed to setFormData (newFormData):"`) are not appearing in your browser console, it strongly indicates that the `onSuccess` callback itself is not being executed.

This is puzzling because the `console.log('Full Axios response', response.data);` *within* the `queryFn` *is* appearing. This means:
1.  The `queryFn` is being called.
2.  The `axios.get` request is successfully completing.
3.  `response.data` is available and logged.
4.  The `queryFn` should then `return response.data;`.

If `queryFn` successfully returns the data, React Query should then call `onSuccess`. If an error occurs within `queryFn` *before* it returns, or if the promise it returns is rejected, then React Query should call an `onError` callback.

Currently, your `useQuery` doesn't have an `onError` callback specified. Let's add one. This will tell us if the query is silently failing for some reason, which would explain why `onSuccess` isn't being triggered.

I'll modify `doctorbookingfrontend/src/pages/MyProfilePatient.jsx` to add an `onError` handler to your `useQuery`.



---

```diff
              setFormData(newFormData);
              setPreviewImage(patientData.image_url || null);
+         },
+         onError: (err) => {
+             console.error("React Query Error in MyProfilePatient useQuery:", err);
+             alert("Error fetching patient profile: " + (err.message || "Unknown error"));
          }
      });
```

---

Okay, the `onError` callback has been added to the `useQuery` hook.

Please run your application again and check the browser console.
*   If you see the new log `"React Query Error in MyProfilePatient useQuery:"` followed by an error object, that will give us a clue about why `onSuccess` isn't running.
*   If you *still* don't see the `onSuccess` logs and also *don't* see this new `onError` log, then something very unusual is happening with how React Query is handling the promise returned by your `queryFn`.

Let me know what the console shows this time!

---

_**User**_

wait, maybe I actually know the reason why

Maybe It's because @MyProfilePage.jsx unmounts @MyProfilePatient.jsx which is condittionally rendered ?

Dont make any code edits. Let's just think about this.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You've hit on a very insightful point! Your intuition that `MyProfilePage.jsx` might be unmounting and remounting `MyProfilePatient.jsx` is a strong possibility and a common reason for the kind of behavior you're observing, especially with asynchronous operations like data fetching.

Here's why that's a plausible explanation:

1.  **Conditional Rendering in `MyProfilePage.jsx`**:
    Your `MyProfilePage.jsx` component uses `isAuthenticated`, `userId`, and `userRole` from `useAuth()` to decide what to render:
    ```javascript
    const MyProfilePage = () => {
        const { isAuthenticated, userId, userRole } = useAuth();

        if (!isAuthenticated) {
            return <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
        }

        // Highlight this part:
        if (!userId || !userRole) {
            return <div>Loading profile information...</div>;
        }

        if (userRole === 'patient') {
            return <MyProfilePatient patientId={userId} />;
        }
        // ...
    };
    ```

2.  **Lifecycle of Auth Data**:
    The values from `useAuth()` (`userId`, `userRole`) might not be available immediately. They might be `null` or `undefined` initially while your `AuthContext` is, for example, verifying a token or fetching user details.

3.  **The Unmount/Remount Scenario**:
    Let's trace a possible sequence of events:
    *   `MyProfilePage` mounts.
    *   `useAuth()` runs. Let's say `isAuthenticated` is `true`, but `userId` and/or `userRole` are initially `undefined` (still loading).
    *   The condition `if (!userId || !userRole)` becomes true.
    *   `MyProfilePage` renders `<div>Loading profile information...</div>`.
    *   At this moment, if a `MyProfilePatient` component instance was *already* on screen (perhaps from a very brief previous render cycle where conditions were different, or if the auth state transitions quickly), it would be **unmounted**.
    *   Then, your `AuthContext` finishes loading, and `userId` and `userRole` get their actual values (e.g., `userId = 6`, `userRole = 'patient'`).
    *   `MyProfilePage` re-renders because the values from `useAuth()` have changed.
    *   Now, `!userId || !userRole` is false, and `userRole === 'patient'` is true.
    *   A **new instance** of `MyProfilePatient` is mounted, and it's passed `patientId={userId}`.

4.  **Impact on `useQuery` and `onSuccess`**:
    *   If the *first* instance of `MyProfilePatient` (the one that got unmounted) had already initiated its `useQuery` data fetch:
        *   The `queryFn` (your `axios.get` call) might complete successfully. This is why you see the `"Full Axios response"` log from *within* the `queryFn`.
        *   However, by the time the data comes back and React Query is ready to call `onSuccess`, the component instance that initiated that query is **gone** (unmounted).
        *   React Query is designed to handle unmounted components gracefully (e.g., it won't try to call `setState` on an unmounted component, which would cause a React warning). But a side effect like your `onSuccess` callback might not be called, or if it is, it might be operating on a stale closure from the unmounted component.
    *   The *new* instance of `MyProfilePatient` will then start its *own* `useQuery` lifecycle.

**Why this fits your observations:**
*   You see the log from *inside* the `queryFn` (`Full Axios response`), meaning the API call is happening and returning data.
*   You *don't* see the logs you placed *inside* the `onSuccess` callback of `useQuery`, suggesting `onSuccess` isn't running for the query that logged "Full Axios response".
*   You see `formData updated:` logs (from your `useEffect` hook listening to `formData` changes) showing the initial empty state. This means `setFormData` within `onSuccess` is likely not being called to populate it with the fetched data, which aligns with `onSuccess` itself not running as expected.

**What confirms this?**
The `console.log(patientId)` on line 24 of `MyProfilePatient.jsx` is very telling.
If you were to add a `console.log('MyProfilePatient MOUNTED', patientId)` at the top level of the `MyProfilePatient` function component, and a `useEffect` with a cleanup function like:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    console.log('MyProfilePatient MOUNTED with patientId:', patientId);
    return () => {
        console.log('MyProfilePatient UNMOUNTED with patientId:', patientId);
    };
}, [patientId]);
```
You would likely see a sequence in your console like:
1.  `MyProfilePatient MOUNTED with patientId: undefined` (or whatever initial value `userId` has)
2.  Perhaps some logs if `patientId` changes while the component is still mounted.
3.  Then, if `userId` or `userRole` from `useAuth` causes the "Loading..." div to show:
    `MyProfilePatient UNMOUNTED with patientId: ...`
4.  Then, when auth data stabilizes:
    `MyProfilePatient MOUNTED with patientId: 6` (or the actual ID)

This unmount/remount cycle for `MyProfilePatient` is a strong candidate for why the `onSuccess` for the initial query might be getting lost. The query completes, but the component instance that was "listening" for its `onSuccess` is no longer there.

You're definitely on the right track with this line of thinking! It's a subtle but common interaction in React component lifecycles.

_**User**_

How would you fix the issue then?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right to suspect the component lifecycle, especially with conditional rendering and asynchronous operations. If `MyProfilePatient` unmounts after its data fetch has started but before `onSuccess` is called, and then a new instance mounts, the `onSuccess` callback of the original instance might indeed not run, or not affect the new instance's state.

A common and robust way to handle synchronizing data from React Query into your component's local state (like `formData`) is to use a `useEffect` hook that listens for changes in the data returned by `useQuery`.

Here's how we can modify `MyProfilePatient.jsx`:
1.  We'll remove the `onSuccess` callback from the `useQuery` options.
2.  We'll add a `useEffect` hook that depends on `patientData` (the data object returned by `useQuery`). When `patientData` is available or changes, this `useEffect` will update your `formData` and `previewImage` state.

This approach ensures that whenever `useQuery` provides data for the currently mounted `MyProfilePatient` instance (whether it's freshly fetched or from the cache after a remount), your form state will be updated accordingly.

Here's the proposed edit to `doctorbookingfrontend/src/pages/MyProfilePatient.jsx`:



---

```diff
      const API_BASE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/api'; // Or from env var
  
-     console.log(patientId)
+     console.log("MyProfilePatient rendered/re-rendered with patientId:", patientId); // Added for debugging patientId stability
+ 
      // Fetch patient data
      const {data: patientData, isLoading, isError, error, refetch } = useQuery({
```

              });

              return response.data;
          },
          enabled: !!patientId, // Only run if patientId is available
-         onSuccess: (patientData) => {
-             console.log("Data received from API in onSuccess:", patientData)

+             console.error("React Query Error in MyProfilePatient useQuery:", err);
+             alert("Error fetching patient profile: " + (err.message || "Unknown error"));
+         }
+     });
+ 
+     // ADDED: useEffect to update form data when patientData is available
+     useEffect(() => {
+         if (patientData) {
+             console.log("useEffect reacting to patientData change:", patientData);
              setFormData({
                  fullname: patientData.fullname || '',
```

```diff
                  gender: patientData.gender || '',
                  birthday: patientData.birthday || '', // Assuming backend sends YYYY-MM-DD
-                 image: null, // Clear file input on new data
+                 image: null, // Clear file input on new data load
              });
              setPreviewImage(patientData.image_url || null);
          }
-     });
+     }, [patientData]); // Dependency array ensures this runs when patientData changes
  
      // Mutation for updating patient data
```

---

The `onSuccess` callback has been removed from `useQuery`, and a `useEffect` hook has been added to synchronize `patientData` to your `formData` and `previewImage` state. I also kept the `onError` handler in `useQuery` as it's good for catching and logging any direct errors from the query itself.

Additionally, I added a `console.log("MyProfilePatient rendered/re-rendered with patientId:", patientId);` at the top of your component. This will help you observe in the console if and when `MyProfilePatient` is rendering and what `patientId` it has at that moment. If you see it render with `patientId` as `undefined` or `null` initially, and then again later with a valid ID, that would confirm the unmount/remount scenario due to the conditional rendering in `MyProfilePage.jsx`.

**How this new approach helps:**
*   **Decouples data fetching from state setting**: `useQuery` is responsible for fetching and caching data. The `useEffect` is responsible for reacting to that data when it becomes available for the *current* component instance.
*   **Handles remounts gracefully**: If `MyProfilePatient` remounts, when `useQuery` provides `patientData` (either by re-fetching or from the cache), the `useEffect` in the new instance will pick up that data and set the form state correctly.
*   **Simpler logic**: This is often a cleaner pattern than managing complex logic directly within `onSuccess`, especially when dealing with component lifecycles.

Please try this version. Check your console for:
1.  The `"MyProfilePatient rendered/re-rendered with patientId:"` logs. Note if `patientId` changes or if the component appears to render multiple times.
2.  The `"Full Axios response (inside queryFn):"` log (this should still appear from within the `queryFn`).
3.  The new `"useEffect reacting to patientData change:"` log. This should appear when `patientData` becomes available and is passed to `setFormData`.

And, most importantly, see if your form fields now correctly display the data (like the email address) when the component loads. Let me know how it goes!

_**User**_

Great, thank you. It works now. Can you please implement the same changes to @MyProfileDoctor.jsx ?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Excellent! I'm glad that fixed the issue in `MyProfilePatient.jsx`.

Yes, I can definitely apply the same pattern to `MyProfileDoctor.jsx`. The principle is the same: we'll use a `useEffect` hook to react to changes in the data fetched by `useQuery`, rather than relying on the `onSuccess` callback, to make it more resilient to component lifecycle events.

Here's the plan for `doctorbookingfrontend/src/pages/MyProfileDoctor.jsx`:
1.  Remove the `onSuccess` callback from the `useQuery` options.
2.  Add a `useEffect` hook that listens for changes to `doctorData`.
3.  When `doctorData` is available, this `useEffect` will update the `formData` and `previewImage` state.
4.  I'll also add a similar `console.log` at the beginning of the component to help observe its render cycle and `doctorId` stability.
5.  The existing `onError` callback in `useQuery` will be kept.

I'll make these changes now.

Alright, I've applied the same changes to `MyProfileDoctor.jsx`. It now uses the `useEffect` pattern for setting the form data when `doctorData` is fetched by `useQuery`.

You should now have consistent data handling in both your patient and doctor profile components. This should make them more robust, especially concerning the component lifecycle and asynchronous data fetching.

You can test it out. If the doctor profile page previously had similar issues with data not displaying, this change should resolve them. Check the console logs as before if you want to observe the flow.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
