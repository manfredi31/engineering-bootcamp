This is a Habit Tracker web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Let's break down the key components:

## Structure Overview

The application is a single-page web app that allows users to create, track, and manage habits. The habits are categorized into two types: life habits and work habits.

### HTML (index.html)
The page structure includes:
- A header with the title "Habit Tracker"
- A form for adding new habits with:
  - A text input field
  - Tag selector (life or work)
  - Submit button
- Two columns to display habits by category:
  - Life habits column
  - Work habits column
- Empty state messages for when no habits exist
- A dark mode toggle button

### JavaScript (script.js)
The core functionality is powered by a Habit class and several functions:

1. **Habit Class**:
   - Properties: id (using UUID), text, tag, completed status, and creation date
   - Methods for toggling completion, editing, and converting to/from JSON

2. **Core Functions**:
   - `init()`: Initializes the app, loads data, sets up event listeners
   - `addHabit()`: Creates new habits from form input
   - `renderHabits()`: Dynamically builds the UI for all habits
   - `toggleHabit()`: Marks habits as complete/incomplete
   - `deleteHabit()`: Removes habits
   - `editHabit()`: Enables inline editing of habit names
   - `saveHabits()` and `loadHabits()`: Persist habits in localStorage

3. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - Creates habit elements dynamically
   - Handles event listeners for user interactions
   - Updates UI based on habit state changes

### CSS (styles.css)
The styling includes:
- Responsive layout with clean, modern design
- Two-column layout for habit categories
- Visual indicators for habit types (color-coded)
- Checkbox and text styling for completed habits
- Dark mode toggle functionality
- Mobile-responsive design

## Key Features
1. Add new habits with text descriptions
2. Categorize habits as "life" or "work"
3. Mark habits as completed with visual feedback
4. Delete unwanted habits
5. Edit habit text inline
6. Data persistence using localStorage
7. Empty state messaging when no habits exist
8. Dark/light mode toggle

The application demonstrates core web development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, responsive design, and object-oriented JavaScript with classes.
