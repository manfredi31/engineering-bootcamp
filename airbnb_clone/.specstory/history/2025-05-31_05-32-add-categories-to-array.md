add these to the categories array

I'll help you add the categories shown in the image to the existing categories array in `Categories.tsx`. I notice that the new categories include Skiing, Castles, Camping, Arctic, and Cave, each with their respective icons and descriptions.

Let me add these to the file:

---

```diff
  import { TbBeach, TbMountain, TbPool } from 'react-icons/tb';
  import CategoryBox from "../CategoryBox";
- import { GiWindmill, GiIsland, GiBoatFishing } from 'react-icons/gi';
+ import { GiWindmill, GiIsland, GiBoatFishing, GiCastle, GiForestCamp, GiCaveEntrance } from 'react-icons/gi';
  import { MdOutlineVilla } from 'react-icons/md';
+ import { FaSkiing } from 'react-icons/fa';
+ import { BsSnow } from 'react-icons/bs';
  import { useLocation, useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom";
  
```

```diff
          icon: GiBoatFishing,
          description: 'This property is close to a lake!'
+     },
+     {
+         label: 'Skiing',
+         icon: FaSkiing,
+         description: 'This property has skiing activities!'
+     },
+     {
+         label: 'Castles',
+         icon: GiCastle,
+         description: 'This property is in a castle!'
+     },
+     {
+         label: 'Camping',
+         icon: GiForestCamp,
+         description: 'This property has camping activities!'
+     },
+     {
+         label: 'Arctic',
+         icon: BsSnow,
+         description: 'This property has camping activities!'
+     },
+     {
+         label: 'Cave',
+         icon: GiCaveEntrance,
+         description: 'This property has camping activities!'
      }
  ]
```

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Added imports for the new icons: `FaSkiing`, `BsSnow`, and additional Gi-prefixed icons (`GiCastle`, `GiForestCamp`, `GiCaveEntrance`)
2. Added the five new categories to the categories array with their respective:
   - Labels
   - Icons
   - Descriptions

I notice that there's a small issue with the descriptions for Arctic and Cave categories - they currently have the camping activities description. Let me fix that:

---

```diff
          label: 'Arctic',
          icon: BsSnow,
-         description: 'This property has camping activities!'
+         description: 'This property is in an arctic location!'
      },
      {
          label: 'Cave',
          icon: GiCaveEntrance,
-         description: 'This property has camping activities!'
+         description: 'This property is in a cave!'
      }
  ]
```

---

I've now updated the descriptions to be more appropriate for the Arctic and Cave categories. All the new categories have been successfully added with their correct icons and descriptions. The categories will appear in the navigation bar when you're on the main page of your application.

add these too

I'll help you add these additional categories (Desert, Barns, and Lux) to the Categories.tsx file. I'll need to import the new icons as well.

```diff
  import { TbBeach, TbMountain, TbPool } from 'react-icons/tb';
  import CategoryBox from "../CategoryBox";
- import { GiWindmill, GiIsland, GiBoatFishing, GiCastle, GiForestCamp, GiCaveEntrance } from 'react-icons/gi';
+ import { GiWindmill, GiIsland, GiBoatFishing, GiCastle, GiForestCamp, GiCaveEntrance, GiCactus, GiBarn } from 'react-icons/gi';
  import { MdOutlineVilla } from 'react-icons/md';
  import { FaSkiing } from 'react-icons/fa';
  import { BsSnow } from 'react-icons/bs';
+ import { IoDiamond } from 'react-icons/io5';
  import { useLocation, useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom";
  
```

```diff
          icon: GiCaveEntrance,
          description: 'This property is in a cave!'
+     },
+     {
+         label: 'Desert',
+         icon: GiCactus,
+         description: 'This property is in the desert!'
+     },
+     {
+         label: 'Barns',
+         icon: GiBarn,
+         description: 'This property is in the barn!'
+     },
+     {
+         label: 'Lux',
+         icon: IoDiamond,
+         description: 'This property is luxurious!'
      }
  ]
```

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Added imports for the new icons:
   - `GiCactus` and `GiBarn` from react-icons/gi
   - `IoDiamond` from react-icons/io5
2. Added the three new categories to the categories array:
   - Desert with the cactus icon
   - Barns with the barn icon
   - Lux with the diamond icon

All categories have been added with their respective icons and appropriate descriptions. The navigation bar will now show all these additional options when you're on the main page of your application.
