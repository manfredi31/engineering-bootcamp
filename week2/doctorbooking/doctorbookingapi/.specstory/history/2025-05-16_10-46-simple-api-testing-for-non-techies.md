# Simple API Testing for Non-Techies (2025-05-16 12:46:27)

_**User**_

I want to test each of my API endpoint. Can you generate data and API calls for me to test? I am very very non technical. Explain me how will I test them please. I am very very non technical

explain like i'm 12 years old, be extremely first principles so i really understand everything intuitively and bottom up and exactly what is happening, write out intermediate states of all code you provide so i can really follow  intuitively what is happening, , add tiny code diffs for each concept so i really understand how it compares to the previous sota,  assume i know nothing,, show me both the extremes of the concept and the problem people had before starting to use it

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you test your API endpoints in a very simple way! Let me first check what endpoints you have available.

Let me search through your codebase to find the API endpoints:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "@bp.route" • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me try another search to find your routes:

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "@.*route" • **6** files</summary>

Perfect! I can see all your API endpoints. Let me explain this in a very simple way:

# Understanding APIs - Like a Pizza Delivery Service! 🍕

Imagine your API is like a pizza restaurant that takes orders over the phone. Each "endpoint" is like a different phone number for different services:
- One number to check the menu
- Another to place an order
- Another to check your order status

In your case, you have these main services (endpoints):

1. **Authentication (Like Getting a Customer ID)**
   - Register: `/register` (POST)
   - Login: `/login` (POST)

2. **Viewing Information (Like Looking at the Menu)**
   - See all doctors: `/doctors` (GET)
   - See doctor's available times: `/doctors/<doctor_id>/slots` (GET)
   - See specific time slot: `/slots/<slot_id>` (GET)

3. **Making Appointments (Like Ordering Pizza)**
   - Book appointment: `/appointments` (POST)
   - View your appointments: `/my-appointments` (GET)

# Let's Test Step by Step! 🚀

I'll help you test these using a tool called HTTPie, which is already installed in your project. Think of it like a special phone that can call all these services.

First, let's start your server. Open your terminal and run:

---

```bash
cd /Users/manfredi.bernardi/Documents/engineering_bootcamp/week2/doctorbookingapi && flask run
```

---

_**User**_

I already started the server and installed httpie

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Now let's test each endpoint step by step, like we're going through a story! 📚

# Step 1: Create an Account (Register) 👤
First, let's create your account. It's like signing up for a new service:

---

```bash
http POST http://localhost:5000/auth/register email=test@example.com password=test123 name="Test User"
```

---

_**User**_

use @http://127.0.0.1:5000  and not local host please

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, let's use `127.0.0.1:5000`! I'll walk you through testing each endpoint step by step. 

# Step 1: Create an Account (Register) 👤
This is like creating your profile at the doctor's office:

---

```bash
http POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/register email=test@example.com password=test123 name="Test User"
```

---

_**User**_

just email and password. no name as you can see by looking at the @routes.py 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, I apologize! Looking at your `auth/routes.py`, I can see we need `email`, `password`, and `role` (which can be either "doctor" or "patient"). Let me correct the command:

# Step 1: Create an Account (Register) 👤
Let's register as a patient first:

---

```bash
http POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/register email=test@example.com password=test123 role=patient
```

---

_**User**_

done

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now that you're registered, let's log in to get your access token (it's like getting your hospital ID card that you'll need to show for all other operations).

# Step 2: Login to Get Your Token 🔑
Use the same credentials you just registered with:

---

```bash
http POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/login email=test@example.com password=test123 role=patient
```

---

_**User**_

done, the API has given me a Token

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Now you have your access token - think of it like your VIP pass that you'll need to show for all other operations. Let's save it to make our next commands easier. Copy the token you received (it's a long string starting with "ey...") and we'll use it in all our next requests.

# Step 3: Let's See Available Doctors 👨‍⚕️
First, let's see all doctors (you'll need to replace YOUR_TOKEN with the actual token you received):

---

```bash
http GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/doctors "Authorization:Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

---

_**User**_

I have my token saved as env key

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, that's perfect! Since you have your token saved as an environment variable, we can use it directly. Let's continue with our testing:

# Step 3: See Available Doctors 👨‍⚕️
Let's see all doctors in the system:

---

```bash
http GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/doctors "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

_**User**_

keep going!

---

_**Assistant**_

# Step 4: Check Doctor's Available Slots 📅
Now that we've seen the doctors, let's check available time slots for a specific doctor. Let's say we want to see slots for doctor with ID 1:

---

```bash
http GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/doctors/1/slots "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

_**User**_

lets book an appointment!

---

_**Assistant**_

# Step 5: Book an Appointment 📝
To book an appointment, we need to send a POST request with the slot ID we want to book. Let's create an appointment using a slot ID (let's say slot_id 1):

---

```bash
http POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/appointments "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" slot_id=1
```

---

_**User**_

it says that the slot is already booked. can we check the status of that specific slot to see if its actually booked?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, absolutely! We can check the status of a specific slot using the `/slots/<slot_id>` endpoint. Let's check slot ID 1:

---

```bash
http GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/slots/1 "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

_**User**_

it's indeed booked. let's try to book another slot

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try booking a different slot! First, let's look at the available slots for a doctor again (this way we can see which slots are still free), and then we'll try booking one of those:

---

```bash
http GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/doctors/1/slots "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

_**User**_

actually so here it doesnt check for available slots! we should return just the ones where is_booked is false 
we built the logic down in the last endpoint. can you quickly recreate it there?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes! Looking at the code, we should filter out the booked slots in the `/doctors/<int:doctor_id>/slots` endpoint. Let me help you modify that endpoint to only show available slots:

---

```diff
      if doctor is None:
          return jsonify({"error": "Doctor not found"}), 404
-     return jsonify([slot.serialize() for slot in doctor.slots])
+     # Only return slots that are not booked
+     available_slots = [slot.serialize() for slot in doctor.slots if not slot.appointment]
+     return jsonify(available_slots)
  
  
```

---

Now when we check the doctor's slots, we'll only see the available ones! Let's try checking the available slots again:

---

```bash
http GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/doctors/1/slots "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

_**User**_

lets book slot 2

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try booking slot 2:

---

```bash
http POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/appointments "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" slot_id=2
```

---

_**User**_

I booked. I want to check my appointments

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's check all your appointments using the `/my-appointments` endpoint:

---

```bash
http GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/my-appointments "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

_**User**_

Great!
